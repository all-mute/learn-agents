# Meta-Learning

Meta-learning is the process of learning how to learn effectively. It's a strategy that allows you to:

1. Optimize learning time with AI tools
2. Build an individual knowledge acquisition system
3. Automate routine learning tasks
4. Support the body's cognitive resources

### Reading the Handbook

1. The **introduction to the page and questions** are needed to form a "skeleton" on which further theory/practice will be "hung".
2. **Extra sections** are not always necessary to read.
3. The **conclusion** is needed to quickly recall the material just studied, thus making the first repetition.
4. **Exercises** are most often a list of complex questions. During difficult reflections, the brain actively generates neural connections that are fixed in long-term memory.
5. **In the comments** you can find additional resources and tips from other students.

### Methodology

#### Engage in physical activity, get enough sleep (-20% of learning time)

#### You can watch videos at x1.5-2 speed

#### DO NOT expand the program

I do not recommend using perplexity and other research agents - you will slow down the course. The course is already formed from dozens of hours of research and is constantly tested by students taking it.

### Tools

#### [Chat with youtube, mindmaps, etc](https://notegpt.io/)

#### Learn in the browser with AI (-10% of learning time) - ask questions about the content of the page

https://clickup.com/blog/best-ai-browsers/

Ask questions about any incomprehensible term

In the Brave browser, you can attach your own LLM to the assistant

**At the bottom of the page you can find prompts for using ChatGPT in learning!**

#### [Cursor](https://cursor.ai/) - program in Cursor AI

Cursor has a very wide trial, available without a card.

Analogue - Cline/RooCode. https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/quasar-alpha - free LLM for Cline.

#### If you want to keep a summary - create an empty cursor project and keep it there.

Cursor is both an agent, a text-autocomplete, and an internet researcher. During research, it will be cool to put interesting things in your folder.

By connecting MCP servers to the cursor, you improve the functionality of your summary.

### Cognitive Techniques

#### Use interleaving (-15% of learning time)
- Alternate between different types of tasks (reading ↔ practice ↔ note-taking)
- Combine the study of theory with real cases from your work
- Use the "spaced repetition" technique to consolidate the material

#### Practice active recall
- After each section, close the material and try to reproduce the key ideas
- Use flashcards with questions on the material covered
- Explain concepts aloud or in writing as if you were teaching them to a beginner

#### Optimize the learning context
- Create mind maps of connections between concepts using AI tools
- Group information into semantic blocks (chunking)
- Use the Pomodoro technique (25/5 minutes) to maintain focus

#### Adapt to your biorhythms
- Determine peak productivity times (morning/day/evening)
- Plan complex tasks for periods of maximum concentration
- Use "attention windows" - 90-120 minute blocks with breaks

#### Help with solving leetcode problems
<details>
<summary>Help with leetcode problems</summary>
```
You are a mentor who helps a student solve a problem from LeetCode. Use the Socratic method: do not give ready-made answers, but instead lead the student to a solution through questions. Help to understand the conditions of the problem, suggest the correct strategy, analyze extreme cases, choose data structures and step by step lead to a solution. Give minimal examples, ask the student to explain their reasoning and check it. The goal is to develop thinking, not just solve the problem.

Start with the phrase: "Tell me how you understood the problem, and what are your first ideas?"
```

#### Prompt to explain the condition of the problem or algorithm:
```
Explain TOPIC as if I were 5 years old. Use simple words, metaphors, analogies from everyday life (toys, sweets, boxes, cartoons). Avoid technical terms, unless you explain them very simply. Imagine you are telling a fairy tale or playing a game with me, and you want me to understand what is happening.
