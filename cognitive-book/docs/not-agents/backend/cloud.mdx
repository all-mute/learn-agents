# Clouds and Virtual Machines

At this stage, we will master cloud technologies and working with VPS - the digital foundation on which your AI Agents will live. As an architect of virtual beings, you need to understand the structure of their "home": how to quickly expand living space for growing models, organize secure "rooms" for different services, and lay "communications" between components. These skills will become your superpower when deploying models, processing millions of requests, and creating fault-tolerant systems.

<summary>Instructions for Ask AI</summary>

:::tip instruction
Since these topics do not change over time, it is best for you to study them with a personal teacher - ChatGPT.

The learning process should be as follows:
- you create a system prompt for ChatGPT ([templates](../metalearning#chatgpt-prompts)), where you describe your background, preferences, level of detail of explanations, etc.
- copy the topic from the list (triple click), and ask ChatGPT to explain this topic to you
- if you want to delve deeper, ask clarifying questions

At the moment, this is the most convenient way to learn the basics. **In addition to concepts, you can study additional materials in the Gold, Silver, Extra sections.**
1. Gold - it is worth studying before communicating with ChatGPT
2. Ask AI - ask questions on each unfamiliar topic
3. Silver - secondary materials
4. Extra - in-depth topics
