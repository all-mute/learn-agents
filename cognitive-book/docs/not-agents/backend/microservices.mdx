# Microservices and System Architecture for Applied AI

Imagine microservices as modular spacecraft, and Docker as your personal spaceport for assembling them. Here you will learn how to design "orbital stations" for AI Agents: breaking down monolithic systems into autonomous satellite services, configuring their interaction through interstellar protocols (REST/gRPC), and automating deployment with CI/CD launch vehicles. These skills will allow your neural networks to scale like a galactic empire, update without downtime, and survive failures of individual components without collapsing the entire system.

Since these topics do not change over time, it is best to study them with a personal tutor - ChatGPT.

The learning process should be as follows:
- you create a system prompt for ChatGPT ([templates](../metalearning#chatgpt-prompts)), where you describe your background, preferences, level of detail of explanations, etc.
- copy the topic from the list (triple click), and ask ChatGPT to explain this topic to you
- if you want to delve deeper, ask clarifying questions

At the moment, this is the most convenient way to learn the basics. **In addition to concepts, you can study additional materials in the Gold, Silver, Extra sections.**
1. Gold - should definitely be studied before communicating with ChatGPT
2. Ask AI - ask questions on each unfamiliar topic
3. Silver - secondary materials
4. Extra - in-depth topics

### 2. Architectures for GenAI

#### Standard Architecture for an AI Agent

- we need a proxy to the LLM to comply with rate-limiting
- we need a proxy to the external API to comply with rate-limiting and caching results
- we need a gateway in front of the backend to classify requests, determine user roles (paid tier, free tier), set limits on context size, etc., set rate-limiting, etc.
