Since these topics do not change over time, it is best to study them with a personal tutor - ChatGPT.

The learning process should be as follows:
- you create a system prompt for ChatGPT ([templates](../metalearning#chatgpt-prompts)), where you describe your background, preferences, level of detail in explanations, etc.
- copy the topic from the list (triple click), and ask ChatGPT to explain this topic to you
- if you want to delve deeper, ask clarifying questions

Currently, this is the most convenient way to learn the basics. **In addition to concepts, you can study additional materials in the Gold, Silver, Extra sections.**
1. Gold - should definitely be studied before communicating with ChatGPT
2. Ask AI - ask questions on each unfamiliar topic
3. Silver - secondary materials
4. Extra - in-depth topics
