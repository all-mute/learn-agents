## Introduction to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes interaction between applications and language models (LLM), such as Claude from Anthropic. Introduced in late 2024, MCP allows AI assistants to access external data, tools, and APIs through a standardized interface.

Figuratively speaking, MCP can be compared to a USB port for AI applications. It allows AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources – from the file system and databases to external APIs and services.

MCP servers are programs that implement the MCP protocol and provide tools, resources, and prompts for AI clients. They can provide access to various data sources (files, documents, databases) and APIs, expanding the capabilities of AI systems.


## Categories of Platforms for MCP Servers

Based on the conducted research, four main categories of platforms related to MCP can be distinguished:

1. **Development Frameworks** - libraries and tools for creating MCP servers
2. **Registries and Catalogs** - platforms for finding and installing ready-made MCP servers
3. **Hosting Platforms** - services for hosting and managing MCP servers
4. **Management Tools** - applications for installing and administering MCP servers

## Frequently Asked Questions About MCP Platforms

### What is MCP and why is it needed?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes interaction between AI models and external tools/data. It allows AI assistants, such as Claude, to securely connect to external data sources and tools, expanding their capabilities.


### Which MCP platform is best for beginners?
For beginners, it is recommended to use EasyMCP (TypeScript) or FastAPI-MCP (Python) if you are familiar with the respective languages. You can also use graphical tools such as MCPHub to manage existing servers without programming.


### Can MCP be used with models other than Claude?
Yes, although the MCP protocol was originally introduced by Anthropic for Claude, it is open and can be used with other LLMs. Many clients, such as Cline and Cursor, already support MCP, and the list of compatible models continues to grow.


### Is it safe to use MCP servers?
MCP servers can have different levels of security. Official servers usually follow recommended security practices, but caution should be exercised when using third-party servers. It is recommended to check the source code, use trusted sources, and limit server access to only the necessary resources.


### What alternatives exist for MCP?
Alternatives to MCP include other frameworks for creating tools for AI, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, API integrations without a standardized protocol, and proprietary solutions from different LLM providers. However, MCP is distinguished by standardization and ease of integration.


### How to ensure security when using MCP servers?
To ensure security when using MCP servers, it is recommended to:
- Use servers with authentication support (Composio, Pipedream MCP)
- Limit server access to only the necessary resources
- Use control tools such as mcp-guardian
- Regularly update servers to the latest versions
