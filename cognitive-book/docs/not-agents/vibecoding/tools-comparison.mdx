## 1. Introduction and Methodology

Vibe coding is a relatively new approach to software development that is characterized by the use of artificial intelligence to automate the code writing process. This approach allows both experienced developers and people without technical experience to create applications and software by describing their ideas in natural language.

This analysis examines various vibe coding tools available on the market to determine their strengths and weaknesses, as well as to identify the most suitable tools for various use cases.

### Evaluation Methodology

The following key parameters were selected for the comparative analysis of the tools:

1. **AI Integration Model**
   - Evaluation of the types of AI models supported (proprietary or open source)
   - Depth of integration and degree of user control over AI
   - Completeness of coverage of the development process

2. **Scope and Technology Support**
   - Supported programming languages and project types
   - Specialization for specific frameworks or versatility

3. **Autonomy and Automation Level**
   - Ability to automatically generate applications from a text description
   - Need for manual intervention
   - Response to changes in requirements

4. **Development Ecosystem Integration**
   - Compatibility with version control systems
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - Compatibility with existing repositories and code base

5. **Third-Party Services Integration**
   - Support for external services "out of the box"
   - Availability of integration templates
   - Automation capabilities when connecting services

Each parameter was evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
- 1 = Very weak implementation
- 2 = Weak implementation
- 3 = Average implementation
- 4 = Strong implementation
- 5 = Exceptionally strong implementation
