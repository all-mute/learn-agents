# How to Contribute

We welcome new contributors to our project! This document will help you understand how to contribute to the development of the Learn Agents project - an interactive book about AI Agents.

## What is contributing?

Contributing is the process of making a contribution to an open project. The contribution can be different:
- Creating new modules or blocks
- Updating outdated information
- Translation into other languages
- Fixing minor errors in the content
- Improving UI/UX

:::tip
To make quick changes, you can click the "Edit this page" button at the bottom of each page.

## Why should I do this?

- Expertise exchange center: you can share your experience and knowledge with others and get feedback
- Volunteering: for personal branding, resume boosting
- Learning how to use your product

## [Which pages are needed as soon as possible?](orders)

## I have an insight, but no time to write the material

## How to start

:::danger be proud of what you do
Imagine that your material is read by thousands of students. Respect their genius, respect their time. I want them to spend time only on what will be useful for creating the future.
:::

### Philosophy

1. Read the `/intro` page "About the textbook": values, principles
2. Before writing a module, it is recommended to agree on the topic with the board of teachers. How? [tg](https://t.me/nongilgamesj)

### How to write a module from scratch

[Module template](https://github.com/all-mute/learn-agents/blob/main/template-ru.mdx)

<details>
<summary>Each module - a page on this site - consists of the following parts:</summary>

#### Introduction
Start with a brief introduction that explains what will be studied on this page. Add motivation to interest the reader. Good motivation is solving a life problem, an industrial case, a story of failure.

Learning objectives: Define what the reader should be able to do after studying the material. This will help focus on key aspects.

#### Questions
List the main questions that will be discussed. This will help the reader understand what to pay attention to.

#### Learning steps
Divide the material into logical steps or stages. This can be a sequence of actions or concepts that need to be learned.

As little material as possible should be included in the main steps - but enough to master the following modules and find an Applied AI job (as a guide)

Additional steps: Include additional steps for a deeper study of the topic, if necessary.

#### Module summary

It is useful to read it so that the brain runs through the material again

#### Exercises
Difficult questions. While thinking about them, it will be difficult for you, but this is normal. It is at this moment that the brain actively forms new neural connections.

### Telling about your product or topic indirectly related to agents

Selling is helping - but your product can only be indirectly present in the lesson. You will also have to talk about competitors.

- If it directly hits with agents and critical knowledge for work, then it goes into the roadmap

- If it hits with agents but knowledge is not required for work, then it goes into the roadmap with a note of bonus/professional material (green/purple checkmark on the map)

- If it does not hit with agents, it is placed in an extra block, with links to the page from the main program
Or on the pages of the main program, but in extra steps

## Content creation

<details>
<summary>Content creation tips</summary>

### [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs)

### [Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.x/markdown-features)

### Project structure

The content is located in the following directories:
- English version: `/docs/`
- Russian version: `/i18n/ru/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`

### Formatting

- Use Markdown for basic formatting
- Use MDX for more complex components
- Store images in `/static/img/`

### Example of adding new material

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add metadata to the beginning of the file:
   ```mdx
   ---
   sidebar_label: Title for the sidebar
   ---

   # Page title
   ```
3. Write and format your content

### Adding a page to the navigation

To make your new page appear in the sidebar navigation, you need to add it to the `sidebars.ts` file in the project root:

1. Open the `sidebars.ts` file
2. Find the appropriate category for your page
3. Add the path to your file to the appropriate section:

```typescript
// Example of adding a new page to the Handbook category
{
  type: 'category',
  label: 'Handbook',
  items: [
    'handbook/introduction',
    'handbook/contributing', // existing pages
    'handbook/your-new-page', // your new page
  ],
},
```

Note that the path is specified without the `.mdx` extension and relative to the `docs/` or `i18n/ru/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/` directory.

## Review process

After creating a Pull Request, your changes will be reviewed by the project team.

Thank you very much for your contribution to the project! Together we are making knowledge about AI Agents more accessible to everyone.

## How to specify yourself as the author of the material

<details>
<summary>How to specify yourself as the author of the material</summary>

To specify yourself as the author of the page, you need to follow two steps:

### 1. Add information about yourself to the author file

Author data is stored in the `blog/authors.json` file. Add your information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "your_key": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your position or role",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-account",
    "image_url": "https://github.com/your-account.png",
    "socials": {
      "github": "your-account",
      "linkedin": "your-linkedin-profile",
      "email": "your-email@example.com",
      "x": "your-twitter-account"
    },
    "description": "A brief description about you (optional)"
  }
}
```

All fields except `name` are optional, but it is recommended to specify at least one social network.

### 2. Specify yourself as the author in the frontmatter of your page

At the beginning of your `.mdx` file, add the `authors` field to the frontmatter section:

```mdx
---
sidebar_label: Title for the sidebar
authors: your_key
---

# Page title
```

You can also specify multiple authors through an array:

```mdx
---
sidebar_label: Title for the sidebar
authors:
  - your_key
  - another_author
---
```

Or specify author information directly:

```mdx
---
sidebar_label: Title for the sidebar
authors:
  - name: Your Name
    title: Your position or role
    url: https://github.com/your-account
    image_url: https://github.com/your-account.png
    socials:
      github: your-account
---
```

After these changes, your author information will be displayed under the page title, including the avatar and links to social networks.

:::note
Make sure that the author key in `authors` exactly matches the key in the `blog/authors.json` file, otherwise the author information will not be displayed.
