# What are AI Agents

## Definition

An **AI Agent** is an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that perceives its environment through sensors, makes decisions based on the information received, and performs actions that affect this environment to achieve certain goals.

In a more formal definition, an agent is an entity that:
1. **Perceives** its environment
2. **Interprets** perceptions
3. **Reasons** based on its knowledge
4. **Makes decisions** about what actions to take
5. **Executes** these actions

## Key Characteristics of AI Agents

### Autonomy

Agents must function without direct human intervention or other systems, making independent decisions. The degree of autonomy can vary from fully autonomous systems to semi-autonomous ones requiring periodic intervention.

### Proactivity

Unlike reactive systems that simply respond to requests, agents can take initiative, set goals, and work toward achieving them without direct instructions.

### Adaptability

The agent's ability to adapt to changes in the environment, learn from experience, and improve its performance over time.

### Sociability

Many AI Agents must interact with humans or other agents, requiring social abilities: communication, cooperation, coordination, and understanding of human intentions.

### Rationality

The agent's ability to act in such a way as to achieve its goals, based on available knowledge and resources. A rational agent always chooses actions that maximize expected utility.

## Difference from Other AI Systems

AI Agents differ from other artificial intelligence systems in the following aspects:

| Aspect | Traditional AI Systems | AI Agents |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Initiative | Reactive, respond to requests | Proactive, can initiate actions |
| Interaction | One-time transactions | Continuous interaction with the environment |
| Goals | Fixed functionality | Pursue goals, adapt |
| Autonomy | Require constant instructions | More independent in decision making |
| Perception | Limited context perception | Complex environment perception |

## AI Agent Components

A typical AI Agent consists of the following key components:

1. **Sensors** — mechanisms that allow the agent to perceive information from the environment
2. **Perception interpreters** — systems for processing and interpreting input data
3. **World model** — the agent's internal representation of the environment and its state
4. **Goal system** — determines what the agent aims to achieve
5. **Decision-making mechanism** — selects actions based on goals and perceptions
6. **Execution system** — performs the selected actions, affecting the environment
7. **Memory** — stores information about past experiences, knowledge, and states

## Examples of AI Agents

### Personal Assistants
Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant with features that allow them to act autonomously.

### Autonomous Vehicles
Self-driving cars, drones, delivery robots.

### Agents in Virtual Environments
Bots in video games, virtual characters in simulations.

### Software Agents
Workflow automation systems, network monitoring, trading bots.

## Conclusion

AI Agents represent the next step in the evolution of artificial intelligence systems, transitioning from passive tools to active, autonomous assistants. They combine various AI technologies to create holistic systems capable of interacting with the real world, making decisions, and achieving goals.

In the following sections, we will explore the history of agent technology development, various types of agents, and the main tools for creating them.
