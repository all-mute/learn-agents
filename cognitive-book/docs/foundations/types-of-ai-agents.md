# Types of AI Agents

In this section, we will examine various types of artificial intelligence agents, their classifications, and characteristics.

## By Degree of Autonomy

### Simple Reactive Agents
* Act only based on current perception
* Have no memory of past states
* Examples: simple chatbots, basic reflex systems

### Agents with Memory
* Track internal state to account for past experience
* Can learn based on accumulated information
* Examples: personalized recommendation systems, assistants with dialogue history

### Goal-Oriented Agents
* Have explicit goals and strive to achieve them
* Plan their actions for optimal goal achievement
* Examples: autonomous robots, game agents, task automation systems

### Fully Autonomous Agents
* Operate without direct human intervention
* Capable of independent decision-making in complex situations
* Examples: autonomous vehicles, research robots

## By Information Processing Method

### Symbolic Agents
* Based on rules and logical inferences
* Use explicit knowledge representation
* Well-explainable but limited in processing unstructured data

### Neural Agents
* Use neural networks for decision-making
* Effective in working with unstructured data
* Less transparent in decision-making logic

### Hybrid Agents
* Combine symbolic and neural approaches
* Utilize advantages of both methods
* Actively developing direction in AI agent creation

## By Architecture

### Monolithic Agents
* All functions implemented within a single system
* Simpler to develop but less flexible

### Modular Agents
* Consist of specialized modules
* More flexible and scalable

### Multi-Agent Systems
* Multiple agents interact to solve tasks
* Allow solving complex problems through division of labor

## By Application Domain

### Communication Agents
* Specialize in human interaction
* Examples: chatbots, virtual assistants

### Research Agents
* Automate scientific research
* Analyze data and formulate hypotheses

### Industrial Agents
* Optimize production processes
* Monitor quality and safety

### Educational Agents
* Personalize educational experiences
* Adapt to learners' needs

## Conclusion

The diversity of AI agent types reflects the breadth of their application and the continuous development of artificial intelligence technologies. The choice of agent type depends on the specific task, available data, and required level of autonomy.
