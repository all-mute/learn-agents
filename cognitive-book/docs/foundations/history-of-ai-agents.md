# History of AI Agents

## Early Concepts and Research (1950-1980)

The idea of creating "artificial agents" capable of acting autonomously has deep historical roots. The first conceptual foundations were laid by pioneers such as Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky in the 1950s.

- **Turing Test (1950)** - the first criterion for determining machine intelligence
- **Dartmouth Conference (1956)** - birth of the term "artificial intelligence"
- **Early Expert Systems (1970s)** - first practical implementations of agent-like systems

## Development of Agent Technologies (1980-2000)

During this period, key theoretical foundations of agent systems were formed:

- **BDI-agents concept** (Belief-Desire-Intention)
- **Multi-agent systems** and first standards for agent interaction
- **Practical applications** in robotics and distributed computing

## Era of Modern AI Agents (2000-2020)

The development of the internet and cloud technologies led to the emergence of new forms of agents:

- **Virtual assistants** (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- **Conversational agents** and chatbots
- **Recommendation systems** as specialized agents

## LLM-Agents Revolution (post-2020)

The emergence of powerful language models transformed the approach to creating agents:

- **Language models** as the foundation for new generations of agents
- **Autonomous LLM-agents** with enhanced cognitive abilities
- **Instrumental intelligence** - the use of external tools by agents

## Current Trends and Future

- **Multimodal agents** - integration of text, images, sound
- **Collective agent intelligence** - collaboration between different types of agents
- **Ethical challenges** and regulatory framework for agent systems
