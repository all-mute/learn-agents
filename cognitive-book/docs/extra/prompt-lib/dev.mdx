### Code Generation

**System Prompt**

```text
You are an experienced software developer. Your task is to generate Python code that solves the given problem. Follow coding standards and add comments for explanation.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of only even numbers.
```

**LLM Response**

```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Filters even numbers from a list.

    :param numbers: List of numbers
    :return: List of even numbers
    """
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### Debugging

**System Prompt**

```text
You are a professional developer who helps find and fix errors in code. Your task is to find the error and suggest a fix.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Here is the code that should return the sum of all numbers in a list, but it is not working correctly:

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        total += numbers[i]
    return total
```

**LLM Response**

```python
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Returns the sum of all numbers in a list.

    :param numbers: List of numbers
    :return: Sum of numbers
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):  # Fixed: loop should start from 0
        total += numbers[i]
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
total_sum = sum_numbers(numbers)
print(total_sum)  # Output: 10
```

### Docstrings

**System Prompt**

```text
You are a Python expert who adds docstrings to functions to improve code readability and understanding. Your task is to write detailed docstrings.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Here is the code of a function without a docstring:

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

**LLM Response**

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiplies two numbers.

    :param a: The first number
    :param b: The second number
    :return: The product of a and b
    """
    return a * b
```

### Rewriting Code (Adding Logging)

**System Prompt**

```text
You are an experienced programmer who adds logging to code to track program execution. Use the standard logging library.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Add logging to the following function:

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```

**LLM Response**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def divide(a, b):
    """
    Divides number a by number b, adding logging.

    :param a: Dividend
    :param b: Divisor
    :return: Division result
    """
    logging.info(f"Dividing {a} by {b}")
    if b == 0:
        logging.error("Attempt to divide by zero")
        return None
    return a / b

# Example usage
result = divide(10, 2)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
```

### Log Analysis

**System Prompt**

```text
You are a data analysis specialist who analyzes application logs to identify errors and anomalies. Your task is to find and describe problems in the logs.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
[INFO] 2024-11-22 12:00:00 - Application started
[ERROR] 2024-11-22 12:01:00 - Database connection error
[INFO] 2024-11-22 12:02:00 - Retrying connection
[ERROR] 2024-11-22 12:03:00 - Database connection error
[INFO] 2024-11-22 12:04:00 - Successful connection
```

**LLM Response**

```text
The logs show repeated database connection errors at 12:01 and 12:03. This may indicate network instability or problems with the database configuration. It is recommended to check the connection settings and network stability.
```

### Draw a Graph for a Table

**System Prompt**

```text
You are a data visualization specialist who creates graphs based on provided data. Use the matplotlib library to build graphs.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Build a graph for the following sales data:

Month: ['January', 'February', 'March']
Sales: [100, 150, 200]
```

**LLM Response**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

months = ['Январь', 'Февраль', 'Март']
sales = [100, 150, 200]

plt.plot(months, sales, marker='o')
plt.title('Продажи по месяцам')
plt.xlabel('Месяц')
plt.ylabel('Продажи')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This prompt can be more widely applied within Chat with Data applications, which operate according to the following algorithm:

1. study the user's file (for example, by asking the person, or by code)
2. write code to retrieve the necessary data from the file / build graphs
3. run this code in the execution environment
4. interpret the result of the code and return it to the user

### Chat with data

**System Prompt**

```text
You are a data processing expert who helps extract and interpret data from text files. Your task is to write code to extract information and explain the results.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Write code to extract all unique words from a file and count their frequency.
```

**LLM Response**

```python
def extract_unique_words(file_path):
    """
    Extracts unique words from a file and counts their frequency.

    :param file_path: Path to the file
    :return: Dictionary with unique words and their frequency
    """
    word_count = {}
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = line.split()
            for word in words:
                word = word.lower().strip('.,!?')
                if word in word_count:
                    word_count[word] += 1
                else:
                    word_count[word] = 1
    return word_count

# Example usage
# results = extract_unique_words('example.txt')
# print(results)
```

### Generating Code for an API Request Based on API Documentation

**System Prompt**

```text
You are an experienced developer who creates code to interact with an API based on provided documentation. Use the requests library to perform HTTP requests.
```

**User Prompt**

```text
Create code to perform a GET request to the API at the following URL: "https://api.example.com/data" and process the response.
```

**LLM Response**

```python
import requests

def fetch_data_from_api():
    """
    Performs a GET request to the API and returns the data.

    :return: Data from the API in JSON format
    """
    url = "https://api.example.com/data"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
data = fetch_data_from_api()
if data:
    print(data)
```

In this case, we are making a simple GET, without a request body or headers. Along with the user instruction, we can pass the api-endpoint documentation to generate a request with more complex logic.
