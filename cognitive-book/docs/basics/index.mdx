# About this block

## What will be in the Basics block

:::info
In the Basics block, we will form the foundation that will be necessary for studying any Applied AI (GenAI, AI Agents, AgentOps) Engineering topics - modules within this handbook and information **beyond it** - on other resources.
:::

#### Main topics:

- **First project + free API keys**: practical implementation of the first AI Agent using free resources
- **What is LLM**: introduction to large language models, their principles of operation and capabilities
- **OpenAI API**: studying the OpenAI application programming interface, the main functions and methods of interacting with AI
- **Prompt engineering**: techniques for creating effective requests to language models to obtain the desired results

#### Additional topics:
- **Meta-learning**: approaches to effective learning and mastering new technologies in the field of AI
- **LLM use cases**: overview of practical scenarios for using language models in various fields
- **How to choose an LLM**: criteria for choosing a suitable language model for specific tasks
- **Vibe coding**: a creative approach to programming using AI

#### Lightweight backend development:
- **Chunks**: working with data fragments and context
- **Internet**: connecting agents to the network
- **Linux**: basic skills in the Linux environment
- **Databases**: storing and processing data for AI Agents
- **Microservices**: architecture of distributed AI systems
- **Resilience**: creating stable and reliable AI solutions

## Why are the modules structured the way they are?

Each module - a page on this site - consists of the following parts:

- **Introduction and questions to the module** - it is recommended to read in order to create a "skeleton" in your head, on which new knowledge will be hung in the future
- **Steps** - mandatory material, the base
- **Extra Steps** - additional materials that can be studied if interested
- **Now we know** - summary of the module - it is useful to read it so that the brain runs through the material again
- **Exercises** - difficult questions. While thinking about them, it will be difficult for you, but this is normal. It is at this moment that the brain actively forms new neural connections.

## Additional Information

### For the skeleton of the entire future course in your head

:::warning
Before studying all the materials, you can watch this video at x2 speed. The goal is not to memorize the material, but to create a "skeleton" in your head, on which new knowledge will be hung in the future.
