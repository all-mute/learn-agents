# LLM Applicability

Let's see what other tasks LLMs can be used for in one-shot mode.

## Questions

- What is NER - Named Entity Recognition?
- What else, besides the notorious *summarizations, translations, code generation*, can we ask of LLMs?
- Can an LLM perform the role of a manager - write prompts, Google queries, write specifications for developers?

## Steps

### 1. Study prompts (there's no other quick way to learn)

Visit both sites:

1. https://www.promptingguide.ai/prompts

2. [llm use cases in extra section](../extra/prompt-lib/)

Skip the use cases that are **1000%** clear to you from the title. It is advisable to read everything else in order to improve your awareness and prompt-*intuition*.

### E1. bonus

Not a very informative video, but the best there is on YT.

## Exercises

- Think about what instructions LLMs cannot follow now, or follow very poorly?
- What instructions do you think LLMs will perform poorly in 2030? In 2040?
