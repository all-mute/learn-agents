# AI Agents Are Changing the World

In 2025, the world is being stormed by AI Agents, but so far they can't create themselves. Even tech giants like AWS recognize the huge potential of agent platforms. And it's not just big tech — a whole wave of startups is now abandoning traditional chatbots in favor of more advanced agent-based systems.

Although some of these platforms haven't changed anything except the text on their landing pages, it's already clear that the role of an AI Agent developer will become one of the most sought-after professions in 2025. However, since the field is still in its early stages, no one really understands what to learn, let alone how to become such a developer.

In this article, I'll finally reveal who an AI Agent developer is, what skills you'll need, and most importantly, provide a complete roadmap that you can follow right now. Let's go!

## Why I Understand AI Agents

My name is David, I'm an AI Agents fanatic who's been in this trend since 2022. Previously, I worked as an AI architect in the YandexGPT team, a DL developer, and participated as a co-founder/employee in more than 10 AI startups, including in big tech.

I am currently the CTO of an international venture fund, where I automate internal processes with agents and create AI-insight tools. By the way, in the last two months, I have found a job for myself and also hired several AI Agent developers. Therefore, I understand this topic well from both the applicant's and the employer's point of view.

## What are AI Agents

Now let's figure out what AI Agents are. Most tech influencers define them as either automations or AI employees. In my opinion, both of these definitions are misleading.

On the one hand, AI Agents have much more autonomy than ordinary automations. AI automations work on your backend anyway — even if the whole world burns to the ground, the automation will simply continue to run as if nothing had happened.

On the other hand, AI Agents have less autonomy than your own employees, because employees can disobey you. You can give them as many instructions as you want, but they can still make their own decisions and do things their own way.

I like the following definition the most: agents are autonomous executors who plan, execute, and finish solving a task.

At the moment, the biggest problem hindering the mass adoption of AI Agents is their reliability. To make agents reliable, you need to carefully configure them for a specific business process, and that's where AI Agent developers come in.

## The Role of an AI Agent Developer

As an AI Agent developer, your role is to ensure that your agents have access to all the necessary resources, tools, and knowledge to perform their tasks.

In essence, this includes:

1. Conducting thorough business research and determining what resources the agent will need
2. Creating tools (as I said, they are the most important when creating an agency)
3. Constant iteration, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and adjusting in a cycle until the agent works stably
4. Deploying agents and integrating them into the client's business so that they work smoothly with employees

## Required Skills

What skills are needed to become an AI Agent developer?

As for soft skills — communication skills and a desire to constantly learn. Communication skills, because you will often have to collect requirements from stakeholders and set clear expectations, which is not easy. A desire to constantly learn, because we are still at a very early stage of AI development, so you need to adapt quickly.

As for hard skills — it's mostly light backend development combined with AI.

## Can Everyone Become an AI Agent Developer in 2024?

In my opinion, yes, everyone can achieve this. Imagine you're trying to excel in a subject like mathematics — you'd have to compete with people who have dedicated their whole lives to it. However, when it comes to creating AI agents, you'll only be competing with those who have just a few months of experience in the field.

So the timing is perfect, even if you're a beginner.

## Do You Need to Know How to Code, or Are No-Code Platforms Enough?

I'm sure you're wondering if there will be a need for coding in the future, or if platforms that don't require it will be enough. The short answer is: yes, code will still be needed. And here's why:

1. To use the most powerful tools for your agent, you will need some programming experience. You can connect agents to existing APIs, but in real-world conditions, we usually create proxy servers, even if we connect to a ready-made API. This allows us to better control the behavior of the tool.

2. In addition, many tools require combining multiple APIs or adding your own logic.

3. Open source will always be at the forefront — not only in creating the most powerful models, but also in using them in creative initiatives.

4. And finally, many of my clients are extremely concerned about data privacy. For them, SaaS platforms are not even an option — they want to deploy agents in their existing infrastructure.

Although SaaS platforms will undoubtedly evolve and be able to meet some customer needs in the future, I believe that knowing code will still be necessary.

Moreover, with the advent of Cursor, the coding process has become like using another SaaS platform, since you can now write code using only natural language.

The Roadmap takes into account all these AI tools, so let's get started!
