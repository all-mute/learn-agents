# AI Agents: A New Era of Technology

AI agents are rapidly changing the technological landscape, opening up unprecedented opportunities for developers and researchers.
Why should we study this domain?

## 1. Agents are simply beautiful!

- **2022**: [StreamLit-PandasAI](https://github.com/worldline/streamlit-pandasai) — AI integration into analytical tools
- **2023**: [You.com](https://you.com/) in autonomous research mode — a new approach to agent-based search engines
- **2023**: The emergence of autonomous Chat with data systems - "Build a dashboard of changes in LTV/CAC users over the past 5 years using our Data Warehouse"
- **2024**: [Junior ML Engineer](https://youtu.be/q1XFm21I-VQ?si=70kO1tBiccm6J47T&t=994) (watch for 3 mins, 16:30 - 19:00) by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)
- **2025**: [Manus](https://youtu.be/K27diMbCsuw?si=vhvBBzXLRG81ZUPz) (4 min video)

## 2. Money is flowing here!

In 2024, the AI Agents market is estimated at $300 billion, with current consumption at only $1.6 billion. This indicates enormous growth potential.

#### Large-scale investments:
- **USA**: [$500 billion](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)
- **Europe**: [$100 billion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/france-invest-109-billion-euros-ai-macron-announces-2025-02-09/)
- **China**: $300 billion

All these funds are directed towards the development of industrial AI, creating a huge demand for qualified specialists.

#### Shortage of specialists

The first scientific publications on AI agents appeared only in the summer of 2023. In 2024, the first courses, applications, and infrastructure began to appear. Most teachers around the world have not yet had time to understand this area, and the few students who have delved into the topic have already founded their own startups and are hiring employees themselves.

#### Scaling problem:

One of the main problems of AI startups today is the horizontal scaling of the team of AI Agents engineers. Companies are in a hurry to take a dominant position in their niches, but there are practically no specialists on the market even with basic knowledge.

#### Career prospects

[AI Agents - salary research for RU/EU/US markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1jhtu6v/genai_frameworks_popularity_on_job_market_research/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

- **Salaries in Europe** start from €60,000 per year
- **Salaries in the USA** — from $100,000 per year
- **Web3 + AI** offers even higher compensation

To start a career in this field, it is enough to create only 3 small projects.

#### High demand for specialists

Every month, investments are made in hundreds of startups developing AI agents. New directions are being launched within technology giants. Companies cannot afford to spend six months searching for high-class specialists, so they prefer to take suitable candidates and train them with the necessary skills.

## Conclusions:

- **Investment in the industry**: huge
- **Demand for engineers**: extremely high
- **Number of specialists**: extremely small
- **Educational infrastructure**: is just being formed

*And those who teach this profession on the stream (courses/universities) have not yet had time to form. Let's get on the hype train first!*
