# AI Agents Are Changing the World

In 2025, the world is being stormed by AI Agents, but so far they can't create themselves. Even tech giants like AWS recognize the huge potential of agent platforms. And it's not just big tech — a whole wave of startups is now abandoning traditional chatbots in favor of more advanced agent-based systems.

Although some of these platforms haven't changed anything except the text on their landing pages, it's already clear that the role of an AI Agent developer will become one of the most sought-after professions in 2025. However, since the field is still in its early stages, no one really understands what to learn, let alone how to become such a developer.

In this article, I'll finally reveal who an AI Agent developer is, what skills you'll need, and most importantly, provide a complete roadmap that you can follow right now. Let's go!

## What are AI Agents

Now let's figure out what AI Agents are. Most tech influencers define them as either automations or AI employees. Both of these definitions are misleading.

On the one hand, AI Agents have much more autonomy than ordinary automations. AI automations run on your backend anyway — even if the whole world burns to the ground, the automation will just keep running as if nothing happened.

On the other hand, AI Agents have less autonomy than the organization's own employees, because employees can disobey management. You can give them as many instructions as you want, but they can still make their own decisions and do things their own way.

The most accurate definition is: agents are autonomous executors who plan, execute, and complete a task.

At the moment, the biggest problem hindering the mass adoption of AI Agents is their reliability. To make agents reliable, you need to carefully configure them for a specific business process, and that's where AI Agent developers come in.

## The Role of an AI Agent Developer

As an AI Agent developer, your role is to ensure that your agents have access to all the necessary resources, tools, and knowledge to perform their tasks.

Essentially, this includes:

1. Conducting thorough business research and determining what resources the agent will need
2. Creating tools (as I said, they are the most important when creating an agency)
3. Constant iteration, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and adjusting in a cycle until the agent is stable
4. Deploying agents and integrating them into the client's business so that they work smoothly with employees

## Required Skills

What skills do you need to become an AI Agent developer?

As for soft skills — communication skills and a desire to constantly learn. Communication skills are important because developers often have to gather requirements from stakeholders and set clear expectations, which is a difficult task. A desire to constantly learn is necessary, as the AI industry is in its early stages of development and requires rapid adaptation.

As for hard skills — it's mostly light backend development combined with AI.

## Can everyone become an AI Agent developer in 2024?

In my opinion, yes, everyone can achieve this. Imagine you're trying to excel in a subject like mathematics — you'd have to compete with people who have dedicated their whole lives to it. However, when it comes to creating AI agents, you'll only be competing with those who have just a few months of experience in the field.

So the timing is perfect, even if you're a beginner.

## Do you need to know how to code, or are no-code platforms enough?

The short answer is: yes, code will still be needed. This is due to several reasons:

1. Using the most powerful tools requires programming experience. Even when connecting to ready-made APIs, proxy servers are usually created in real-world conditions to better control the behavior of the tool.

2. In addition, many tools require combining multiple APIs or adding your own logic.

3. Open source will always be at the forefront — not only in creating the most powerful models, but also in using them in creative initiatives.

4. Many companies are extremely concerned about data privacy. For them, SaaS platforms are not even an option — they want to deploy agents in their existing infrastructure.

Although SaaS platforms will undoubtedly evolve, experts believe that knowing code will still be necessary.

Moreover, with the advent of Cursor, the process of writing code has become like using another SaaS platform, as you can now write code using only natural language.

The Roadmap takes all these AI tools into account, so let's get started!
