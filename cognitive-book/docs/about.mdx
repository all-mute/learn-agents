# About the Handbook

## What is the AI Agents Handbook

**AI Agents Handbook** is a <u>self-study</u> guide for developing AI Agents,
- covering all topics of Applied AI development
- flexible: you can move quickly, studying only the core material, or delve into additional materials
- practice-first
- zero to hero: you don't need any prior knowledge to start
- the last chapters are dedicated to the cutting edge of science and business.

**Our goal** is to create the world's first end-to-end course on AI Agents development. We are inspired by the legendary resource [d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/).

Quick links:
- [What are Agents?](start-here/index.mdx)
- [Why study AI Agents?](start-here/motivation.mdx)
- [List of required knowledge](start-here/prerequisites)
- [Easy-to-view interactive roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/r/ai-agents-2025-roadmap)

Approximate total volume of core material: 126 hours.

## Values

1. **Agile and up-to-date** - we add materials as quickly as possible, adapting to constantly improving technologies
2. **Practice-First** - practical assignments in each block
3. **Community-Driven** - students and authors help develop the handbook - [how?](/handbook/contributing)
4. **Zero to Hero** - the handbook is planned to be a high-level abstraction that can be studied without in-depth CS and DS knowledge
5. **No empty value** - we create materials ourselves only if we add value to what already exists in the world

## Principles

1. Text format is used to allow for instant changes, as the AI Agents landscape becomes 50% obsolete every 12 months
2. Modules consist of materials from different teachers, in order not to engage in the "rewriting of other people's materials" that is classic for university courses
    - it also gives the opportunity to use lectures from the best teachers in the world
    - and you as a student can at any time deviate from the program and delve into topics that interest you
3. If you find the current material useless or outdated - let us know!

## Program

The main course material is presented in three blocks: **basics**, **junior**, **senior**. You can register on roadmap.sh and interactively mark completed modules: [AI Agents 2025 Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/r/ai-agents-2025-roadmap).

The entire program is divided into blocks, each block consists of modules, inside the module one topic is covered (For example, "Basics of LLM").

#### 1. Basics (~6 hours)

In the basics block, you will <u>write your first agent, gain basic knowledge of LLM, how to work with them, and learn how to write prompts</u> - this is all you need to start learning and developing Agents.

In additional modules, you can study <u>lightweight backend development, LLM use cases, and master vibe-coding</u>.

#### 2. Junior (~40 hours)

- The junior block starts with completing the huggingface course on agents.
- Next, you will learn about the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which is important for business.
- You will go through a workshop on agent and multi-agent architectures
- You will start mastering one of the industrial frameworks for agent development: LangGraph, Pydantic AI or LlamaIndex
- And you will implement a large project of your own!
- The block concludes with modules on AgentOps: infrastructure, agent performance evaluation, accelerated development.

After completing this block, it is recommended to start looking for your first job at a middle-level position. You can continue your education in parallel with your job search.

#### 3. [TBD] Senior (~60 hours)

Mastering agents at a high level is quite easy - therefore, immediately after the junior block comes the senior block. Here we will return to the topics already studied and delve into them: <u>LLM</u>, <u>prompting</u>, <u>backend</u>, <u>RAG</u>, <u>cognitive architectures</u>, <u>benchmarking</u>. New modules for us will be <u>online agent evaluation</u>, <u>feedback-based improvement</u>, <u>meta-agents</u>, <u>Agent2Agent protocols</u>. At the end, you will implement a <u>vertical industrial-grade project</u> with <u>AgentOps infrastructure</u>, <u>memory</u>, and much more.

#### 4. [TBD] TechLead (100 hours +)

Agent developers cannot be characterized as people who completed certain material a long time ago and have since stopped learning. On the contrary - Agents are in the fastest growing part of the industry. Constant learning, FOMO, the search for new technologies - all this is the romance of an AI Agents developer.

This size is planned for already practicing developers to share experience. It will mainly consist of:
- materials on developing agents on modified models
- review of scientific articles
- insights from industry leaders
- evaluation of the best changes in the global landscape
- other frontier topics

#### 5. Not AI Agents (~20 hours)

A module with all the additional information that is not directly related to LLM:
- backend development
- DevOps
- AI security
- ethical aspects
- vibe-coding
- meta-learning
- and other topics

Modules from this block are located along the main material.

:::tip
All these modules from "Not AI Agents" are not required to complete. However, **if you are a beginner developer** - these modules will help you in developing more production-ready agents and finding a job.

**If you are already an experienced developer**, then you will probably only appreciate the materials on meta-learning, vibe-coding.

## What this handbook does not contain

- Training on no-code platforms (but if you want to lead - we will support you)
- Training in programming, the basics of python, git, working with a computer
- Training in Data Science, ML, DL, CV, NLP, applied mathematics
- Methodological materials on writing resumes, job search, passing interviews; support in the learning process, a community of motivated students (but all this is on [merkulov.courses](https://merkulov.courses))
